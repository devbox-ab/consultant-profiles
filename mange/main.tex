  \vspace{-\baselineskip} % Required for vertically aligning minipages

  I am a developer with deep interest in building useful solutions to people's
  problems. I have a passion for performant code that is maintainable,
  readable, and fast. There is no perfect tool for every problem, so I try to
  learn as many tools as possible and master them where appropriate.

  You will find me most skilled in backend services and API design, but I'm
  also comfortable working in web frontend stacks. If I'm not able to dogfood
  my own APIs, how can I tell that they deliver value?

\cvsect{My development philosophy}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\textwidth} %
  \vspace{-\baselineskip}

  I follow the ethos of the software craftsman, where the tools used are
  adjusted according to the situation at hand. Delivering value is most
  important, then it is making sure that the legacy I leave behind stays
  valuable for a long time. Solutions and code needs to be maintainable and
  understandable by as many people as possible. I try to avoid overly clever
  solutions, and I try to pick conservative tech stacks where appropriate.

  Everything I do is test-driven and I strive for quick feedback cycles, both
  from colleagues and from users.

  In order to deliver software efficiently, one must also work well among other
  people. Coding is not a solitary activity, and being able to work together
  with other people of many different backgrounds and skill levels is
  important. I enjoy working in this condition and I love sharing knowledge and
  understanding other people's perspective on things.

  \textbf{Mantras}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item No code is better than a lot of code.
      \item Dependencies are expensive, but custom code can be more expensive.
      \item Explicit is better than implicit.
      \item Code should be working, maintainable, consistent, fast --- in that order.
      \item Testing is not optional (but is so much more than just writing test suites).
      \item Tools should help us. Linters and auto-formatters reduce mental burden.
      \item Real craftsmen sign their work proudly.
      \item ``Legacy'' should not be an ugly word; It's what we all leave behind us.
      \item Most people are well-meaning and knows things I don't know. Don't assume either malice or stupidity.
