\cvsect{My development philosophy}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\textwidth} %
  \vspace{-\baselineskip}

  Mind of creating great code and efficient but robust solutions to realize great visions.\\

  Development is not about working in the office from 8 to 5. It's about creating beautiful art in places and times when you are the most creative and inspired.

  Tests are just as important as the code to build sustainable solutions with confidence.\\

  It's better to focus on fewer things at the time and make them really good, preferably with continuous deployments.\\

  Developer happiness is more important then you think, without an happy environment, it's tough to create good solutions.
\end{minipage}

  \textbf{Mantras}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Enjoy your life, always to the fullest
      \item Delivering value over get caught in details
      \item Quality over shortcuts (with exceptions)
      \item Do stuff you can be proud of
      \item Static office hours are obsolete
      \item The key to success is transparency and honesty
      \item A funtional team is more important than an idea
      \item Strongly considering making \texttt{git dad} an alias
